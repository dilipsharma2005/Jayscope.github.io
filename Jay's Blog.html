You can hit me where it hurts cause I don't mind doing time <br>
and I sail my wooden ship right behind you <br>
with thunder in my head from the fires of her heart <br>
the city's still aflame when they found you <br>

In the windows of the night I could see the burning light <br>
bouncing off the lonely shadow in the cold <br>
on the runway of our love it's coming faster then we can <br>
making promises they we just couldn't hold <br>

you can hit me where it hurts I don't mind doing time
and sail my wooden ship right behind you <br>
with thunder in my head from the fires of her heart
a city a still aflame when we found you <br>

write a message in the sand burn a candle for the man <br>
for the light your burn will surround you <br>
if you hold her like a rose, so hard to let it go <br>
cause the silence is a curse when it fools you <br>

Hit me where it hurts, hit me where it hurts,hit me where it hurts  <br>
You can hit me where it hurts I don't mind doing time  <br>
and I'll sail my burning ship right beside you.</strong> <br></p>
